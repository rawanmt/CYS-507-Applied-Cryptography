Assignment #1, Term2, 2021/2022

Design and implement a simple package based on the RSA algorithm to provide encrypting/decrypting and digital signature signing and verifying.
a.	Generate two prime numbers: p and q. 
b.	Miller Rabin: to test the prime number.
c.	Euclid’s algorithm: to find the encryption key (e) 
d.	Extended Euclid’s algorithm (EEA): to find the decryption key (d).
e.	choose any hash function which is available as free source
f.	A main method to show different usage of RSA including dialogues between two parties (Alice and Bob) that reflect encrypting/decrypting and digital signature signing and verifying

# RSA Cryptosystem

> CYS 507: Individual Assignment on Cryptosystems 
> Assignment #1, Term2, 2021/2022
- Design and implement a simple package based on the RSA algorithm to provide encrypting/decrypting and digital signature signing and verifying.
- a.	Generate two prime numbers: p and q. 
- b.	Miller Rabin: to test the prime number.
- c.	Euclid‚Äôs algorithm: to find the encryption key (e) 
- d.	Extended Euclid‚Äôs algorithm (EEA): to find the decryption key (d).
- e.	choose any hash function which is available as free source
- f.	A main method to show different usage of RSA including dialogues between two parties (Alice and Bob) that reflect encrypting/decrypting and digital signature signing and verifying
